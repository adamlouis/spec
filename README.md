# `spec`

`spec` - an experimental embedded message format and rpc system for real-time, resource-constrained systems, written in Rust.

`spec` is inspired by "specification" for its role as an [interface description language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_description_language) and "speck" for its emphasis on small data.
